This is a Blackjack counting program I wrote in Atom text editor. The purpose of the program is simply to count cards, blackjack style. It has a deck of cards which gets shuffled, and then you draw cards by pressing enter. It will show you the running count. Please leave feedback, I am fairly new to Python. Do not hesitate to point out all the flaws and terrible coding I do, as I'm sure I could have done it a lot better! Thanks for checking it out. 

Peace
